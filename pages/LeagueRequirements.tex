\section{Competition Area}

\subsection{Arena Information}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of Competition Arenas: 2
    % \item An \textbf{additional testing arena} is recommended when the number of participating teams exceeds 18, to provide adequate practice and testing space for all teams.
    \item Space per Arena: \qty{90}{\meter\squared}
    \item Total Competition Area: \qty{180}{\meter\squared} (plus \qty{90}{\meter\squared} for Testing, if applicable)
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Detailed Setup}
The RoboCup@Home Arena is a realistic home setting (apartment-like) consisting of interconnected rooms. A typical configuration is shown in~\reffig{fig:sample_arena_setup}.
The \textbf{minimum arena configuration must include}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a living room,
    \item a kitchen,
    \item two additional rooms (e.g., bedroom, office, dining room, laundry room, foyer, childrens room).
\end{itemize}

There are usually two competition arenas and one additional Testing arena.

\paragraph{Dimensions}
Each arena should be around \qtyrange{90}{120}{\meter\squared}. A minimum of \qty{80}{\meter\squared} is acceptable if robot navigation space is ensured. Typical room sizes are approximately \qtyrange{20}{30}{\metre\squared}.
Robots typically have a base diameter of \qty{70}{\centi\metre}, with extensions for manipulators. The arena must accommodate safe navigation.

\paragraph{Walls}
Walls are fixed and \textbf{must not be altered} during the competition.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum height: \qty{60}{\centi\metre}.
    \item Maximum height: not specified, but audience visibility \textbf{should be ensured}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Doors}
Each arena \textbf{must include}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At least one entrance door (opening inward).
    \item At least one exit door (opening outward).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The two doors (entrance and exit) cannot be in the same room.
        \end{itemize}
    \item All doors with handles (not knobs), which can be closed.
    \item Minimum width: \qty{90}{\centi\metre}, minimum height: \qty{200}{\centi\metre}.
    \item Door thresholds must be smooth or very flat, without steps, lips, or obstacles that could impede robot movement.
\end{itemize}
If these requirements cannot be met, alternative solutions \textbf{must be discussed in advance} with the Technical Committee (TC).

\paragraph{Power Supply}
Each arena \textbf{must provide} at least one freely accessible power outlet.
The outlet may be located either in a corner of the arena or immediately outside the arena boundary.

\paragraph{Floor}
The floor must be even, with minor irregularities allowed (e.g., carpets, transitions). It should not be excessively slippery.
At least \qty{1}{\metre} of free space is required around the arena for robot staging.

\paragraph{Appearance}
Walls and floors should be neutral (monochromatic or lightly textured). Decorative elements such as posters or carpets are allowed.

\paragraph{Additional Setup}
A table must be provided outside each arena for external computing devices of the active team.

\paragraph{Optional Equipment}
The following equipment is recommended for each arena to improve the competition experience but is not mandatory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microphones or audio systems for announcements
    \item Additional display screens for spectators
    \item Computers and cameras for live broadcasting the competition
\end{itemize}


% \subsection{Sponsor Requirements}

% These additional requirements are not mandated by the rules but based on request of sponsors.

% \paragraph{Stairs (for humanoid robots, if applicable)} If humanoid robots participate, an external set of stairs is required. The stairs should preferably have:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item 6--7 steps going up, a landing, and 6--7 steps going down.
%     \item Minimum width: \qty{91}{\centi\metre}, tread depth: at least \qty{28}{\centi\metre}, riser height: \qtyrange{10}{18}{\centi\metre}(typically \qty{17.4}{\centi\metre}).
%     \item Close risers for robot safety.
% \end{itemize}
% Alternatively, if venue stairs meet these requirements and are near the @Home area, they may be used.

\section{Environment Requirements}

The arena must be decorated to resemble a typical apartment.
\paragraph{Mandatory Items}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Plants, mirrors, paintings, posters, picture frames, clocks, candles with holders, books.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Furnishings (minimum)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item a couch,
    \item a coffee or side table,
    \item a small dining table with two chairs,
    \item a trash bin,
    \item a bookcase (or similar shelving) with a minimum shelf spacing of \qty{30}{\centi\metre}
    \item a front-loading washing machine,
    \item kitchen equipment including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a dishwasher,
        \item a sink,
        \item a pantry (tall cupboard with shelves).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Best Practices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid uneven surfaces.
    \item Avoid cables running on the arena floor.
