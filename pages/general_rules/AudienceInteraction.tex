\section{Audience Interaction}\label{sec:rules:audience}
Only some tests require direct interaction with the audience. In order to make all tests more appealing (see \ref{sec:concepts:appeal}) and engaging, informing the audience about what is happening is important.

\subsection{Visualization}\label{sec:rules:audience:visualization}
All scenarios will have a screen, visible to the audience, that the teams can use to display, e.g., a robot's state, world model, and current plan. An example of such a visualization is the \VizBox{} by Loy van Beek (\url{https://github.com/LoyVanBeek/vizbox}). Using and enhancing the capabilities of the \VizBox{} or developing another open source visualization is greatly appreciated and considered a contribution to the \RoboCup\AtHome{} community.
