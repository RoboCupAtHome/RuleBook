\subsection{Standard Platform Leagues}

Standardized platforms allow teams to compete under equal conditions by eliminating all hardware-dependent variables from the tasks; therefore, \emph{unauthorized} modifications and alterations to the robots are strictly forbidden.
This includes, but is not limited to, attaching, connecting, plugging, gluing, and taping components into and onto the robot, as well as modifying or altering the robot structure.
Not complying with this rule leads to an immediate disqualification and penalization of the team (see~\refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}).
Robots are, however, allowed to \enquote{wear} clothes, have stickers (such as a sticker exhibiting the logo of a sponsor), or be painted (provided that the robot provider has approved that).

All modifications to the robots will be examined during the \RobotInspection{} (see~\ref{sec:robot_inspection}).
Note that the \EC{} and \TC{} members may request re-inspection of an SPL robot at any time during the competition.
