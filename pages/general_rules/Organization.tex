\section{Organization of the Competition}\label{sec:procedure_during_competition}

\subsection{Stage System}\label{rule:stages}

The competition is divided into two stages, followed by a \FINAL{}. Each stage consists of a series of tasks designed to test specific robot capabilities, with the \FINAL{} being the final evaluation of the teams' overall performance.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Robot Inspection:} 
	All teams must pass a \RobotInspection{} during the \SetupDays{} to be eligible for competition. (see~\refsec{sec:robot_inspection})

	\item \textbf{\SONE{}:} The first stage of the competition, \SONE{}, is open to all teams that have passed the \RobotInspection{} test. This stage includes tasks that test basic robot capabilities.

	\item \textbf{\STWO:} \STWO{}, is open to the top 50\% of teams from \SONE{}. If the total number of teams is less than 12, up to 6 teams may advance to \STWO{}.
	This stage requires more complex advanced or combinations of abilities.

	\item \textbf{\FINAL:} The top \emph{three teams}, namely the ones with the highest score after \STWO{}, advance to the \FINAL{}.
	The final round features a single integrated task that tests all abilities evaluated throughout the competition.

\end{enumerate}
In cases where there is no significant score difference between teams, the \TC{} may decide to include additional teams in the next stage.

\subsection{Schedule}\label{rule:schedule}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Test Blocks:} Each test is scheduled within a Test Block. During each Test Block, each qualified team is assigned at least two Test Slots. The Restaurant test is an exception, requiring only one Test Slot.

	\item \textbf{Test Slots:} During a Test Slot, a team has a specified amount of time to complete the task.

	\item \textbf{Participation is default:} Teams must inform the \OC{} in advance if they are skipping a Test Block. If they do not provide such notification, they may be penalized for not attending (see~\refsec{rule:not_attending}).
	
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Note that the actual allocation of blocks will be announced by the \OC{} during the \SetupDays{} (see Table~\ref{tbl:schedule}).

\subsection{Scoring System}\label{rule:score_system}

The scoring system for the competition is designed to evaluate robot performance based on task completion. Each task has a primary objective and a set of bonus scores. Teams must complete parts of the main objective to receive any points. Bonuses are not awarded otherwise.

The scoring system has the following constrains:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\FINAL:} The final score is normalized.
	\item \textbf{Minimum score:} The minimum total score per test in \SONE{} and \STWO{} is \scoring{0 points}.
	While teams generally cannot receive negative points, penalties can result in a total score below zero. Specifically, teams may receive penalties for not attending (see~\refsec{rule:not_attending}) and for extraordinary violations (see~\refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}).
\end{enumerate}
