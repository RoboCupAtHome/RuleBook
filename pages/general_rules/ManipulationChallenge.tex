\section{Manipulation Challenge}
\label{sec:rules:manipulationChallenge}

In cooperation with MathWorks and together with the RoboCup@Work league, an additional technical manipulation challenge is offered to \AtHome{} teams starting from 2022. The objective is to use a manipulator, programmed in MATLAB and Simulink, for sorting objects that lie on a table into separate bins near the manipulator. This year, the challenge is simulation-based, using Gazebo as a simulation environment. The overall winner of the challenge will receive a research grant of up to \$5,000; all other participants will receive a certificate of participation.

Teams already registered for RoboCup@Home can participate in the challenge without any additional cost. Note that the challenge does not contribute points towards the overall score of the @Home competition; however, the best @Home team that participates in the challenge may receive a separate certificate for the achievement (even if they are not the overall winner of the challenge). More details about the challenge are provided on the official page: \url{arm.robocup.org}. This includes information about the registration procedure, the competition timeline, and, most importantly, the rules of the challenge.
