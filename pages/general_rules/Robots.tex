\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Registration:} The maximum \term{number of robots} per team is \emph{two}.
	\item \textbf{Regular Tests:} Only one robot is allowed per test. Different robots can be used for different test runs.

\subsection{Appearance and Safety}\label{rule:robot_appearance}

Robots must have a product-like appearance and be safe to operate.
The following rules apply to all robots:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Cover:} Internal hardware (electronics and cables) must be fully covered to ensure safety. The use of visible duct tape is strictly prohibited.
	\item \textbf{Loose cables:} No loose cables should hang out of the robot.
	\item \textbf{Safety:} The robot must not have sharp edges or protruding parts that could harm people.
	\item \textbf{Annoyance:} The robot must not emit continuous loud noises or use blinding lights.
	\item \textbf{Marks:} The robot must not display any artificial marks or patterns.
	\item \textbf{Driving:} Obstacle avoidance is mandatory to ensure safe movement.
\end{enumerate}
The compliance with these rules will be verified during \RobotInspection{} (see \ref{sec:robot_inspection}).
