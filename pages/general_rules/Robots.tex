\subsection{Number of Robots}
\label{rule:robots_number}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Registration:} The maximum \term{number of robots} per team is \emph{two} (2).
	\item \textbf{Regular Tests:} Only one robot is allowed per test. For different test runs, different robots can be used.
	\item \textbf{\FINAL:} In the \FINAL, both robots can be used simultaneously.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Appearance and Safety}
\label{rule:robot_appearance}

Robots should have a product-like appearance and be safe to operate.
The following rules apply to all robots:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Cover:} The robot's internal hardware (electronics and cables) should be covered so that safety is ensured. The use of (visible) duct tape is strictly prohibited.
	\item \textbf{Loose cables:} Loose cables hanging out of the robot are not permitted.
	\item \textbf{Safety:} The robot must not have sharp edges or elements that might harm people.
	\item \textbf{Annoyance:} The robot must not be continuously making loud noises or use blinding lights.
	\item \textbf{Marks:} The robot may not exhibit any kind of artificial marks or patterns.
	\item \textbf{Driving:} To be safe, the robots should be careful when driving. Obstacle avoidance is mandatory.
\end{enumerate}
The compliance with these rules will be verified during \RobotInspection{} (see \ref{sec:robot_inspection}).
