\section{Leagues}\label{sec:leagues}

\AtHome{} is divided into two leagues. One league allows full freedom in choosing the robot, while the other requires all competitors to use the same robot. The official leagues and their names are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \OPL
  \item \DSPL
\end{itemize}

Each league focuses on a different aspect of service robotics by targeting specific abilities.

\subsection{Domestic Standard Platform League (DSPL)}

The main goal of the DSPL is to assist humans in a domestic setting, with a special emphasis on elderly individuals and people with illness or disability.
As a consequence, the DSPL focuses on \AmI{}, \CV{}, \OM{}, safe indoor \NAV{} and \MAP{}, and \TP{}.
The robot used in the DSPL is the \HSR{}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:toyota_hsr}.

\subsection{Open Platform League (OPL)}

The OPL has had the same approach since the foundation of \AtHome{}.
With no hardware constrains, \OPL{} is the league for teams who want to test their own robot designs and configurations, as well as for experienced at-homers.
In this league, robots are tested to their limits without having in mind any specific design constraints, although the scope is similar to the \DSPL{}.
