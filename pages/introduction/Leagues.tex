\section{Leagues}\label{sec:leagues}

\AtHome{} consists of a single league, meaning teams have complete freedom in selecting their robot platform. The official league and its name is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \OPL{}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open Platform League (OPL)}

The \OPL{} has followed the same core philosophy since the foundation of \AtHome{}.
Its main goal is to develop and test robots that can assist humans in domestic environments.
With no hardware constraints, the OPL offers teams full freedom to design and configure their own robots.
This openness allows for a wide range of approaches, making the league accessible to both new and experienced teams.
In this league, robots are pushed to their performance limits without being restricted by predefined design requirements.
