\section{Organization}

\AtHome{} is organized into three subcommittees. The current members of the committees are listed at \url{https://athome.robocup.org/committees/}.

\subsection{Executive Committee --- rc-home-ec@lists.robocup.org}
\label{sec:ec}

The \EC{} consists of members of the board of trustees, and representatives of each activity area, and supervises both the TC and OC.
The committee is responsible for the long-term planning of the league and cast the final vote in all decisions within the competition, including those pertaining to any of the committees and any other affair that requires a qualified vote.
Additionally, the EC must act when any of the committees fail, as it responds to the Trustee board and directs the league accordingly.

\subsection{Technical Committee --- rc-home-tc@lists.robocup.org}
\label{sec:tc}

The \TC{} is responsible for the rules of the league; its main focus is writing the rulebook and refereeing.
The members of the EC are always members of the TC as well.

\subsection{Organizing Committee --- rc-home-oc@lists.robocup.org}
\label{sec:oc}

The \OC{} is responsible for the organization of the competition, namely it creates the schedule and provides information about the scenarios.
The \LOC{}, on the other hand, is responsible for the set up and organization of the competition venue.
