\section{Competition}
The competition consists of two \emph{Stages} and a \FINAL.
Each stage consists of a series of \iterm{Tests} that are being held in a daily life environment.
The best teams from \SONE{} advance to \STWO, which consists of more difficult tests.
The competition ends with the \FINAL, where only the two highest-ranked teams of each league compete to select the winner.
