\noindent\textbf{Safety first!}

\noindent The speed of the robots should ensure safe operation. 
This means that the robot is not allowed to go faster than the local speed limits. 
During operation in an environment with humans it may not exceed a walking pace of humans (6 kph, 3.7 mph). 

At any time when operating the robot inside and outside the scenario the 
owners have to stop the robot immediately if there is a remote possibility 
of dangerous behavior towards people and/or objects. If a referee, member 
of the Technical or Organizational committee, an Executive or Trustee of 
the federation tells the team to stop the robot, there will be no discussion 
and the robot has to be stopped \emph{immediately}.

If the team does not comply, the team and its members can be excluded from 
the ongoing competition immediately by a decision of the RoboCup@Home Technical 
Committee. 
Furthermore, the team and its members can be banned from future competitions 
for a period not less than a year by a decision of the RoboCup Federation 
Trustee Board.
