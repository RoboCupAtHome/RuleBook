\section{Restaurant}
The robot retrieves and serves orders to several customers in a real restaurant previously unknown to the robot.

% \subsection{Focus}
% This test focuses on online mapping, safe navigation in previously unknown environments, gesture detection, human-robot interaction, and manipulation in a real environment.

\subsection{Main Goal}
Take and serve an order to a customer.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts.

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Detect a customer's service request: 200pts (100pts each)
	\item Reach a customer's table without prior guidance/training: 200pts (100pts each)
	\item Use an unattached tray to transport an order: 500pts (250pts each).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} A real restaurant fully equipped and in business.
	There may be real customers and waiters around.

	\item \textbf{Start Location:} The robot starts next to the \emph{Kitchen-bar}.

	\item \textbf{Professional clients:} There are at least three tables occupied with professional operators. At least two have orders.

    \item \textbf{Kitchen-bar:} A table located near the restaurant's kitchen.

	\item \textbf{Barman:} A \emph{Professional Barman} (member of the TC) awaits at the other side of the \emph{Kitchen-bar} for orders to be placed. The \emph{Professional Barman} assists the robot on request.

	\item \textbf{Objects:} Objects to fulfill orders are located on the Kitchen-bar.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Placement:} The referee requests the team to move the robot to the start location.
	\item \textbf{Start:} The referee gives the start signal And starts the timer. The team leaves the area (touching the robot causes immediate disqualification).
	\item \textbf{Instruction:} The robot may use up to one minute to instruct the \textit{Professional Barman}.
	\item \textbf{Fetching and delivering orders:} When a a customer calls the robot, it has to get close and take her order, place the order, and deliver it.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safety First!} This test takes place in a public area. The robot is expected to not even slightly touch anyone or anything and is immediately stopped in case of danger.

	\item \textbf{Fair play:} Upon arrival to the restaurant, only the team leader is allowed next to the robot for watching and charging.
	Tweaking, coding, debugging, or mapping the area in place will lead to immediate disqualification.

	\item \textbf{Orders:} Orders have between one and three objects randomly chosen.
	All edible/drinkable objects from the list of standard objects (see~\refsec{rule:scenario_objects}) are eligible to be part of the orders.

	\item \textbf{Calling customers:} Customers may call the robot any time, even simultaneously.
	Robots can choose to take several orders and place them later on, place an order and pick the next one while the former is being served, or dispatch one order at a time.

	\item \textbf{Placing orders:} By default, the barman will place the order in a basket or tray for the robot to deliver it.

	\item \textbf{Delivering orders:} The robot can either transport each object individually, or using a tray. All delivered objects must be placed on the customer's table.

	\item \textbf{Referees and guidance:} The robot can request to be guided to a customer's table. While guiding, a TC member follows the robot ready to press the emergency stop button.

    \item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per order as follows.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item Being guided to a table causes a score reduction of 200.
		\item Each object handover causes a score reduction of 50pts.
		\item Bypassing manipulation causes a score reduction of 100pts per object.
		\item Not making \emph{eye} contact with a customer while taking an order causes a score reduction of 100pts.
		\item Being told/pointed where is a table/\textit{Kitchen-bar} causes score reduction of 25pts.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Location:} \emph{Restaurant} takes place in a real restaurant.
	When this is not possible, the test can be conducted in any place with the appropriate locations other than the arena.
	In addition, the \emph{Restaurant} location will remain secret until the start of the test.

	\item \textbf{Power outlets, WiFi and ECRA:} The availability of wireless, external computing devices, or electrical outlets can't be guaranteed. Assume unavailability.

	\item \textbf{Disturbances from outside:} If a person from the audience (severely) interferes with the robot in a way that makes it impossible to solve the task, the teams may repeat the test immediately.

	\item \textbf{Instruction:} The robot interacts with the operators, NOT THE TEAM.
	The team is not allowed to instruct anyone.
	All instructions should be provided by the robot itself.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}

The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prepare orders for each client.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OC instructions}
During Setup days:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Check with local (security) management if the possible location, including a sufficient queuing area, can be used for the restaurant test.
\end{itemize}

1 hour before the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Gather all teams and robots to move to some nearby queuing area and instruct the teams how/when to move to the actual test location.
\end{itemize}
