\section{Restaurant}
\label{test:restaurant}

\subsection*{Description}

The robot retrieves and serves orders to several customers in a real restaurant previously unknown to the robot.

\textbf{Main goal:}
	Detect calling or waving customer, reach a customer's table without prior guidance/training. Take and serve all orders.
	
\textbf{Optional goal:}
	Use an unattached tray to transport the order.


\subsection*{Focus}
This task focuses on
\textit{Task planning},
\textit{Online mapping},
\textit{Navigation in unknown environments},
\textit{Gesture detection},
\textit{Verbal interaction} and
\textit{Object manipulation}.	

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]	
	\item \textbf{Locations:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This task takes place in a real restaurant fully equipped and in business. When this is not possible, the test can be conducted in any place with the appropriate locations other than the \Arena{}.
		\item The \emph{Restaurant} location will remain secret until the start of the test.
		\item The robot starts next to the \emph{Kitchen-bar}. It is a table located near the restaurant's kitchen.
	\end{itemize}	 
	\item \textbf{People:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  A \emph{Professional Barman} (member of the TC) awaits at the other side of the \emph{Kitchen-bar} for orders to be placed. The \emph{Professional Barman} assists the robot on request.
		\item There may be real customers and waiters around.
		\item There are at least three tables occupied with professional customers (member of the OC/TC). 
		\item There are at least two tables occupied with regular customers.
		\item Customers may call the robot any time, even simultaneously.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Furniture:} The furniture is not standardized and will be kept the same as the restaurant or place selected for the task.
	\item \textbf{Objects:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Objects to fulfill orders are located on the Kitchen-bar.
	\item Orders have two or three objects randomly chosen.
	\item All edible/drinkable objects from the list of standard objects (see~\refsec{rule:scenario_objects}) are eligible to be part of the orders.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The referee requests the team to move the robot to the start location.
	\item The referee gives the start signal and starts the timer.
	\item The team leaves the area after the start signal.
	\item A TC member follows the robot ready to press the emergency stop button. 
	\item The robot detect calling or waving customer and reach a customer's table.
	\item The robot take the customer's order, place the order, and deliver it.
	\item \textbf{Optionally}, the robot can use an unattached tray to transport the order.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Remarks:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This test takes place in a public area. The robot is expected to not even slightly touch anyone or anything and is immediately stopped in case of danger.
		\item Since this task is performed outside the arena, the time limit may be longer than the others tasks.
		\item The availability of wireless, external computing devices, or electrical outlets can't be guaranteed. Assume unavailability.
		\item The robot interacts with the operators, not the team. The team is not allowed to instruct anyone. All instructions should be provided by the robot itself.
		\item The robot may use up to one minute to instruct the \textit{Professional Barman}.
		\item The robot can request to be guided to a customer's table.
		\item The robot can choose to take several orders and place them later on, place an order and pick the next one while the former is being served, or dispatch one order at a time.
		\item The robot can either transport each object individually, or using a tray. All delivered objects must be placed on the customer's table.
		\item For transport with an unattached tray, the robot must pick up the objects and place them on a tray, pick up the tray, and then place the objects from the tray on the table (first placing the tray on the table is allowed).
		\item If requested, the barman will place the order in a basket or tray for the robot to deliver it.
		\item Upon arrival to the restaurant, only two team members are allowed next to the robot for watching and charging.
		\item If a person from the audience (severely) interferes with the robot in a way that makes it impossible to solve the task, the teams may repeat the test immediately.
		\item Each Deus Ex Machina penalty for skipping manipulation will only be applied twice per order so receiving an order with three objects is not more punishing.
		\item If the robot detects a customer but does not reach their table, the robot must clearly show who was detected to receive points, i.e. displaying a picture of the person.
		\item When a team is at the front of the queue, they are allowed to begin their startup procedure (the robot must remain in place). When it is their turn, they must bring the robot directly and in a straight line from the front of the queue to the start location. Once at the start location only slight movements are allowed (no moving back and forth, no full rotations etc.)
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Disqualification:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Touching the robot after the start signal.
		\item Mapping the area in advance.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Instructions:}

\subsubsection*{To Referee}

The referee needs to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prepare orders for each client.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{To OC}
The OC needs to:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{During Setup days:} Check with local (security) management if the possible location, including a sufficient queuing area, can be used for the restaurant test.
	\item \textbf{1 hour before the test:} Gather all teams and robots to move to some nearby queuing area and instruct the teams how/when to move to the actual test location.
\end{itemize}
