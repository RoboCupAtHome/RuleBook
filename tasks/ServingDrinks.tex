\section{Serving Drinks [Party Host]}
\label{test:serving-drinks}
The robot has to take orders and deliver drinks.

% \subsection*{Focus}

% This test focuses on human detection and recognition, safe navigation and human-robot interaction with unknown people.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Deliver a drink to all people without one.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 750pts (250pts per delivered drink).

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Preemptively informing a guest that the ordered drink is not available (250pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place in the living room.
	Initially there is one person sitting here whom the robot already knows.
	This person is referred as \emph{default guest}.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the \Arena{} at a predefined location near the entrance door.

	\item \textbf{Guests:} There are at least 5 guests in the living room, two standing and three sitting.
	Each guest has assigned a predefined name and has either a drink or a drink request (choice and alternative).

	\item \textbf{Bar:} The bar can be any flat surface where objects can be placed, in any other room but the living room.
	All available beverages are on top of the bar.
	One of the drink requests is not available.

	\item \textbf{Bartender:} The Bartender may be standing either behind the bar or next to it, depending on the \Arena{} setup.
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring.
	Robot score per correct delivered drink.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per guest as follows.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Actively placing order:} Approaching to the robot to place an order causes a score reduction of 100pts.

		\item \textbf{Calling to place order:} Calling the robot (either by shouting or waving) to place an order causes a scoring reduction of 50pts.

		\item \textbf{Revealing unavailable drink:} Telling the robot which drink is unavailable causes a score reduction of 100pts.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Delivering drinks:} When delivering a drink, the robot must greet the guest by stating her name and remembering the chosen drink.
	The robot may either hand-over drinks or have attached a tray.
	When a tray is used, the robot must be sure that the guest is taking the correct drink (guests may try to take the wrong one).

	\item \textbf{Misunderstood names:} If the robot misunderstands the name, the understood (wrong) name is used in the remainder of this test.

	\item \textbf{Changing places:} After giving the order (when the robot is not in the living room), the referees may re-arrange the people.

	\item \textbf{Empty \Arena{}:} For this task only the robot, the guests, and the Bartender are allowed to be in the \Arena{}.
\end{enumerate}
