\section{Receptionist}\label{test:receptionist}

\subsection*{Description}
The robot has to guide two new guests to the living room, introduce them to each other, and offer them a seat.\\
    
\textbf{Main goal:}
    The robot welcomes and assists two newcomers at a party, offering them a seat and maintaining appropriate gaze direction during conversation (at person speaking, direction of navigation).

% \vspace{-5pt}
\textbf{Optional goals:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Open the entrance door for each arriving guest.
	\item Visually describe the first guest for the second guest before reaching the living room
	\item Identify similarities between the guests and the host and incorporate them into the conversation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Focus}

% human detection and recognition, safe navigation and human-robot interaction with unknown people.

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The test takes place in the living room.	
	\item The robot starts inside the \Arena{} at a predefined location.
	\item A table with drinks is prepared near the living room
	\item \textbf{Entrance:} The entrance door is open by default. The team leader can request it to be closed to allow the robot to earn additional points by opening it for the guests.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{People:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Host:} The host's name, favorite drink and interest will be announced before the test. The host is the only person seated in the living room until the robot offers a seat to a guest.

	\item \textbf{Arriving Guests:} Each guest has a name, favorite drink, and one interest.
	Guests arrive separately.
	An arriving guest will either step in front of the robot or wait behind the door if it is closed. 
	The robot must guide each guest to the beverage area and then to the living room, where they are introduced to each other.
	
	\item \textbf{Passive Guests:} A few other individuals (including possibly spectators) are standing in small groups of two or three throughout the arena, but do not obstruct key areas such as the couch, chairs, or beverage table.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}
Both guests arrive separately. The robot either opens the door for the guest or waits for them at the starting location. 
It greets the guest and asks for their name.
The robot then guides the guest to the beverage area, asks for their favorite drink, and indicates whether that drink is available and where it is located on the table.
At a freely chosen moment, the robot also asks for the guest's interest.Afterward, it escorts the guest to the living room and offers a seat. Once both guests are seated, the robot introduces them to each other.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Greeting guests:} Each guest paces slightly left and right during conversation. Other people may appear in the background.
	
	\item \textbf{Looking at person:} The robot must look at the person it is talking to. Guests will move slightly to confirm the robot dynamically follows them with its gaze. Points for gaze tracking are awarded only if the robot continuously tracks the moving person.
	
	\item \textbf{Looking at direction of navigation:} The robot must look in the direction it is navigating. Persistently looking in an unrelated direction or at unrelated people during navigation results in a score deduction.
    
    \item \textbf{Smalltalk} The robot asks each guest for one interest.
    
    \item \textbf{Finding the drink} The robot shows each guest the beverage table, asks for their favorite drink, and tells them if and where the drink is available (left, center, right).
	
	\item \textbf{Seating People:} The robot must clearly point to a location or seat for each guest.

	\item \textbf{Switching Places:} After being seated, guests may switch seats.
	
	\item \textbf{Introductions:} When introducing two people to each other, the robot must clearly identify each guest by name, state their favorite drink, and mention one interest.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Opening Door Timing:} The test time starts either when the first guest enters the arena or 2 minutes after the start signal, whichever comes first.

	\item \textbf{Misunderstanding:} Asking a guest to repeat themselves is acceptable. However, using an incorrect name, drink, or interest will result in a 20 point penalty per item.
		
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring per guest.

	\item \textbf{Additional Seating:} Referees may add chairs to the living room area.
	
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per guest as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Custom Operator:} Since the main focus of the test is HRI, no custom operator is allowed.
		\item \textbf{Alternative HRI:} Using alternative HRI methods to understand a guest results in a 75 point penalty.
		\item \textbf{Recognizing People:} If the robot requires help to identify a person, 200 points are deducted.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Instructions}

\subsubsection*{To Referee}
