\subsection*{Description}
The robot has to take two new guests to the living room to introduce them and offer a free place to sit.\\
    
\textbf{Main goal:}
    Introduce and usher two newcomers to a party and maintain appropriate gaze direction (at person, direction of navigation).

% \vspace{-5pt}
\textbf{Optional goals:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Open the entrance door for each arriving guest.
	\item Describe the first guest for the second guest.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Focus}
\SysI{}, \HRI{}, \PerDet{}, \PerRec
% human detection and recognition, safe navigation and human-robot interaction with unknown people.

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The test takes place in the living room.	
	\item The robot starts inside the \Arena{} at a predefined location near the entrance door.
	\item \textbf{Entrance:} The entrance door is open by default. The team leader can request to close the door to score additional points by opening it for the guests.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{People:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Host:} The host's name and favorite drink will be announced before the test. The host is already sitting in the living room.

	\item \textbf{Guests:} Both guests have a name and favorite drink. An arriving guest will either step in front of the robot or ring the bell if the door is closed. Guests have to be guided to the living room to be introduced. Each of the guest will arrive separately. The sound of the bell will be provided to teams
	during setup period before competition.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Introductions:} When introducing guests, the robot must clearly identify the person being introduced and state their name and favorite drink. Introducing two people means to introduce them to each other.
	
	\item \textbf{Seating People:} The robot must point at a place or location where the guest can sit.
	
	\item \textbf{Switching Places:} Guests may switch places after they were seated.
	
	\item \textbf{Describing the First Guest:} Naming at least 4 characteristics of the first guest, i.e., color of clothes, color of hair, gender, and age, earns bonus points.
	\item \textbf{Looking at person/direction of navigation:} During verbal interactions and descriptions of people, robot 
	looks at the conversational partner. Robot can point at the person being introduce/described or alternate gaze between two people. During navigation robot looks in the direction where it is going. Persistently gazing towards unrelated 
	person or incorrect direction while moving during the task deducts points. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Misunderstanding:} Not understanding the guests and asking them again is fine. Continuing with a wrong name or drink causes a score reduction of 50pts.
		
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial (per guest) scoring.
	
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per guest as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Custom Operator:} Since the main focus of the test is HRI, no custom operator can be chosen.
		\item \textbf{Alternative HRI:} Using an alternative HRI to understand a guest causes a score reduction of 75pts.
		\item \textbf{Recognizing People:} If the robot has to ask for help to identify people, score is reduced by 200pts. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
