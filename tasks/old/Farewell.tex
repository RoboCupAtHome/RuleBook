\section{Farewell [Party Host]}
\label{test:farewell}

\subsection*{Description}
    Some guests are tired, and they call the robot to retrieve their coat. One guest is a medical doctor and needs to leave urgently. 
    It's raining outside and there is only one umbrella, so the robot takes the guests one by one to their cab and returns 
    with the umbrella.\\


\textbf{Main goal:}
The robot escorts two guests to their cab (where the cab driver is standing), with the medical doctor guest first.


\textbf{Optional goal:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Delivering guest's right coat.
	\item Entertaining guest with conversation while ushering person to the cab.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Focus}
\PerDet{}, \NAV{}, and \HRI{}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Locations}: 
		\begin{itemize}
		 \item The test takes place both inside and outside the \Arena{}.
		 \item The robot starts inside the \Arena{} at predefined location.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{People}: Guests -- there are five  in the living room -- three sitting and two standing. At least two of them are doctors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedures}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The guests willing to leave signal their intention.
	\item Robot recognizes the guests willing to leave and escorts them to the cab, one at the time.
	\item \textbf{Optionally}, the robot brings the right coat to the person leaving the \Arena{}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial (per guest) scoring.

	\item \textbf{Guests}: All guests have a name and a coat color assigned.

	\item \textbf{Calling the robot}: Guests willing to leave call the robot (e.g. by waving or shouting) simultaneously.

	\item \textbf{Kicking out guests:} Non-calling guests will refuse to leave the house; the robot must thus confirm that a guest was calling and is willing to leave.


	\item \textbf{Cab/Taxi:} The cab location is identifiable by a \emph{Cab Driver}, who is wearing high-visibility clothing (e.g. a fluorescent vest) and is standing under an open umbrella.

	\item \textbf{Delivering coats:} Coats are hanging on a coat rack near the exit door.
	The robot should hook off the coats autonomously and bring them back to the right people.
	
	\item \textbf{Entertaining conversation:} Robot can ask person being ushered about party they are leaving, tell them jokes or use other topics
	for social interaction that would engage the guest. The guest migh refuse to chitchat or indicate tiredness which should cue the robot
	to cease the interaction. Failing to do so will result in loosing points for the item.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} The scores are reduced if human assistance is received, in particular:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Telling the robot which guest is leaving (e.g. by pointing)
		\item Guiding the robot to the cab
		\item Guiding the robot back to the arena
		\item Handing over a coat to the robot
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
