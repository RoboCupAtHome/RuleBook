\label{test:set-the-table}
The robot has to set the table (presumably for dinner) for one person.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on object perception, manipulation, and planning.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1000pts

	\item Closing the cupboard drawer (100pts)
	\item Laying a place mat first (150pts)
	% \item Leaving the arena (100pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} This test takes place in the arena, in a table close to the cupboard.
	\item \textbf{Table:} Chairs may be placed around the table and won't be removed.
	\item \textbf{Cupboard:} The cupboard doors and drawers are initially closed.
	\item \textbf{Objects:} The objects used in this test can be found in the cupboard, not in their predefined locations.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} The following reductions apply:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Handover:} Handing over an object causes a score reduction of 100pts.
		\item \textbf{Showing objects:} Pointing, or telling to the robot where an object is or where to place it causes a score reduction of 50pts.
		\item \textbf{Placing objects:} Having a human assistant placing an object on the table causes a score reduction of 200pts.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Table setup:} Knife and spoon go on the right of the dish with the mug or cup in front of them; fork and napkin go on the left side; and the bowl is stacked on top of the dish.

	The following distribution is used:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item\textit{Silverware}: Any two different objects (fork, knife, or spoon).
		\item\textit{Tableware}: A dish and any other object (bowl, cup, or mug).
		\item\textit{Napkin}: A cloth or paper napkin.
	\end{itemize}


	\item \textbf{Safe placing:} Objects must be placed with care. It must be clear that the robot is trying to place the object, not throwing or dropping it.

	\item \textbf{Cupboard drawers:} The team decides whether the objects are inside one of the cupboard drawers (and which) or placed on the cupboard.
	When no drawers are available, objects can be placed inside the cupboard. The cupboard door is used instead.

\end{enumerate}
