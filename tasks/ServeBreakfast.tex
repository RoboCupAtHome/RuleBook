\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Locations:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Start location:} The robot starts in the kitchen.
			\item \textbf{Test location:} The test itself takes place in the kitchen.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{People:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item No people are involved in the test, unless the robot requires human assistance.
			\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Furniture:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Table:} The robot serves breakfast on the dinner table.
			\item \textbf{Chairs:} Chairs may be placed around the kitchen table and may be removed upon request by the team.
			\item \textbf{Doors:} The robot does not need to open any doors for finding the breakfast items.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Objects:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All objects used in the test are in their predefined locations when the test starts.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Before the test:} The team informs the referees if they want the chairs around the table to be removed.
	\item \textbf{Test start:} The team moves their robot to the kitchen and starts the task.
	\item \textbf{Serving breakfast:} To serve breakfast, the robot has to place breakfast items on a table (bowl, spoon, cereal box, and milk carton).
	\item \textbf{Pouring cereal:} After placing the breakfast items on the table, the robot should pour cereal into the bowl.
	\item \textbf{Optional goals:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Pouring milk:} After pouring cereal, the robot pours milk into the bowl in order to fully prepare the breakfast.
			\item \textbf{Placing the spoon next to the bowl:} In principle, the spoon can be placed anywhere on the table, but placing it next to the bowl is desired so that it is easily reachable by a person.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safe placing:} Objects must be placed with care, namely the robot should place rather than throw or drop objects.
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} The scores are reduced if human assistance is received, in particular for:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item pointing to an object or telling to the robot where an object is or where to place it

		\item having a human place objects on the table
		\item having a human pour cereal into the bowl
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
