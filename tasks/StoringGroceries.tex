\section{Storing Groceries [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:storing-groceries}
The robot stores groceries into a pantry shelf while paying attention to sorting objects in their appropriate place, i.e.~storing an apple next to other fruits.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on the detection and recognition of objects and their features, as well as object manipulation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Move objects 5 from a table into a shelf, grouping them by category or similarity.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts (100pts per object).\\

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the shelf door (300pts)
	\item Moving a \emph{tiny} object (100pts)
	\item Moving a \emph{heavy} object (100pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial (per object) scoring.
	
	\item \textbf{Location:} The testing area has a shelf and a table nearby.

	\item \textbf{Shelf:} The shelf contains objects arranged in groups either by category or likeliness.

	\item \textbf{Shelf door:} The shelf door is open by default.
	The team leader can request the door to be closed and score additional points for opening it. If the robot fails to open the door, it must clearly state it and request the referee to open it.

	\item \textbf{Objects:} Some of the objects are placed behind the door and cannot be accessed unless the door is open.

	\item \textbf{Table:} The table has 5--10 objects placed on it and the robot can choose which ones to grasp and in what order. On small tables, objects will be added as the robot frees up space.
\end{enumerate}

		\item Telling or pointing out to the robot where to place an object results in a score reduction of 30pts.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Table} The table's rough location will be announced beforehand, having its position either left, right, or behind the robot.
\end{enumerate}
