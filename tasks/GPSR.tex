\section{General Purpose Service Robot}\label{test:gpsr}

The robot is asked to understand and execute commands requiring a wide range of different abilities. \\

\noindent \textbf{Main Goal:} Execute three commands issued by the operator.\\

\noindent \textbf{Optional Goals:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Understand a command given by a non-expert operator.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Focus}
\emph{Task planning}, \emph{object/people detection and recognition}, \emph{object feature recognition}, \emph{object manipulation}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Locations:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Task location:} The task takes place inside the \Arena{}. Commands may require the robot to leave the room. The \Arena{} is in its nominal configuration for this task.
            \item \textbf{Start location:} The robot starts outside the \Arena{}. When the door opens, it must navigate towards the \textit{Instruction Point}.
            \item \textbf{Instruction point:} The robot returns to this point after completing each command to receive the next one.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{People:}
        \begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Professional Operator:} Typically the referee, issues standard commands to the robot.
			\item \textbf{Non-Expert Operator (optional):} A person without robotics expertise (e.g., from the audience). The referee provides the intended command goal to this operator, who then issues the instruction using their own wording.

            For example, the generated command might be \textit{"Bring me a coke from the kitchen."} then the non-expert operator will be told \textit{"The robot should bring you a coke, which is found in the kitchen."}, who then tells the robot \textit{I want a coke. Go to the kitchen and get me one."}

            If the robot consistently fails to understand the non-expert operator (e.g. after two retries), teams can default to a custom operator.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Procedure
% %% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Instruction point:} At least two hours before the test, the referees announce the location of the \textit{Instruction Point}.
	\item \textbf{Test start:} The robot moves to the \textit{Instruction Point} when the arena door is open.
	\item \textbf{Command execution:} The operator instructs the robot to execute a command and the robot performs the task.
	\item \textbf{Back to the instruction point:} The robot goes back to the \textit{Instruction Point} and waits for the next command.
	\item \textbf{Pausing the Timer:} The referee pauses the timer as soon as the robot reaches the instruction point to reset the arena for the next command. The timer resumes once the referee signals the start of the next command.
\end{enumerate}

% Additional Rules

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring (per \emph{completed} command).

	\item \textbf{Command generator:} Tasks will be generated using the official command generator\footnote{\url{https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/CommandGenerator}}.

	\item \textbf{Non-Expert Operators:}
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item Referees must not assist non-expert operators in phrasing the commands.
        \item Teams are not allowed to coach, instruct, or bias non-expert operators. Doing so results in disqualification from the task.
    \end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reductions apply in the following cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use of a custom operator
		\item Bypassing speech recognition with an alternative HRI.
		\item Receiving human assistance to accomplish a command 
		\item Instructing a human assistant to perform the whole task
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Provide the commands to the operators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC Instructions}

At least two hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Generate the robot commands (do not reveal them to the teams).
	\item Announce the location of the instruction point.
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
	\newline
\end{itemize}

\noindent During the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Restore the arena to its nominal state before each command execution.
\end{itemize}
