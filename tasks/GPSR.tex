\section{General Purpose Service Robot}\label{test:gpsr}

The robot is asked to understand and execute commands requiring a wide range of different abilities. \\

\noindent \textbf{Main Goal:} Execute three commands issued by the operator.\\

\subsection*{Focus}
\emph{Task planning}, \emph{object/people detection and recognition}, \emph{object feature recognition}, \emph{object manipulation}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Locations:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Task location:} The task takes place inside the \Arena{}. The \Arena{} is in its nominal configuration for this task. Commands may require the robot to manoeuvre to any part of the \Arena{}.
            \item \textbf{Start location:} The robot starts outside the \Arena{}. When the door opens, it must navigate towards the \textit{Instruction Point}.
            \item \textbf{Instruction point:} The robot returns to this point after completing all of the commands.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{People:}
        \begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Professional Operator:} The referee issues standard commands to the robot.
            If the robot consistently fails to understand after three retries, teams can default to a custom operator.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Instruction point:} At least two hours before the test, the referees announce the location of the \textit{Instruction Point}.
	\item \textbf{Command execution:} The operator provides up to three commands issued consecutively to instruct the robot to perform the tasks. If the operator provides the commands one-by-one, the robot must return to the operator after completing each task. The operator will say "please start now" to initiate the task.
	\item \textbf{Back to the instruction point:} The robot goes back to the \textit{Instruction Point} after completing all of the commands given by the operator.
	\item \textbf{Pausing the Timer:} If commands are issued one-by-one, the referee pauses the timer as soon as the robot reaches the instruction point to reset the arena for the next command. The timer resumes once the referee signals the start of the next command.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring (per \emph{solved} problem).
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Scores:} Score reduction is applied as a percentage depending on the solution.
		\item \textbf{Penalties:} The Repetition penalty is applied before any partial penalties
		\item \textbf{Example:} If picking up trash off the floor is valued as 60\% of the solution, then requesting a handover should be a $ 650 \times 0.6 = 390 $ points penalty for the first pick and  $ \left( 650 - 300 \right) \times 0.6 = 210 $ for the second pick.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Command generator:} Tasks will be generated using the official command generator\footnote{\url{https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/CommandGenerator}}. Once a command has been generated it will be entered into an LLM to re-generate a similar phrase, e.g. the generated command is "get me a coke from the kitchen" re-phrased command is "Go to the kitchen, find a coke, and bring it to me". Each command may be re-phrased up to 3 times.   
	\item \textbf{Test start:} The robot moves to the \textit{Instruction Point} when the arena door is open.

	\item \textbf{Custom Operators:} If a custom operator is used they can choose only one of the re-phrased commands to use.

	\item \textbf{Autonomy Skip:} Score reductions apply in the following cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use of a custom operator.
		\item Bypassing Automatic Speech Recognition.
		\item Receiving human assistance to accomplish a command.
		\item Instructing a human assistant to perform the whole task.
		\item QR codes will not be available.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Provide the commands to the operators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC Instructions}

At least two hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Generate the robot commands and pass through LLM to get a similar command (do not reveal them to the teams).
	\item Announce the location of the instruction point.
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}

\noindent During the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item The arena will be setup for all command executions.
\end{itemize}
