\section{Find My Mates [Party Host]}
\label{test:find-my-mates}
The robot fetches the information of the party guests for the operator who knows only the names of the guests.


\subsection*{Main Goal}
Report to the operator the description and location of at least two party guests.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500 points (250pts per guest).

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Reporting the location and description of a third guest (500pts).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: This test takes place inside the \Arena{} in a predefined room (e.g.~living room).

	\item \textbf{People}: There are 4 people distributed along the room.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per guest.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item -75 pts if a person has to wave the robot in order to be found
		\item -75 pts if a person has to tell the robot where he/she is sitting/standing
		\item -150 pts if a person has to approach to the robot (e.g.~walk and stand in front of it).
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Reporting:} Points are scored only when the robot goes back to the operator and delivers the report in time.

	\item \textbf{Description of a Person:} The description of each guest should be unique; i.e.~not shared with any other guest. This may include clothing, age, height, complexion, skin-color, hair-color, gender, etc.

	\item \textbf{Location of a Person:} A relative location based of the surroundings (e.g.~\textit{The kid is sitting on the coach}, \textit{The tall man is standing beside the lamp}, etc.).
