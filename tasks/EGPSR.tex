\section{Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:egpsr}
Similar to a modern smart-speaker, the robot can be asked to do anything, in plain English, from either Stage of this and former rulebooks.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on the detection and recognition of objects and their features, as well as object manipulation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Execute at least one of the 3 commands requested by the operator.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1500pts (500 points per task)\\

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Attend when called (125pts).
	\item Understand a command given by naive operator (150pts, each).
	\item Provide audio recording and transcript (100pts each).
	\item Autonomously leaving the \Arena{} (150pts).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Location:} The task takes place inside the \Arena{} (some commands might require the robot to go out). The \Arena{} is in its normal state.

	\item \textbf{Start location:} The robot starts outside the \Arena{}. When the door opens, the robot moves towards the \textit{Standby Point}.

	\item \textbf{Operators:} A \emph{professional operator} (i.e.~the referee) commands the robot by default.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial (per \emph{completed} command) scoring.
	\item \textbf{Command Generator:} Tasks will be generated using the official \emph{GPSR Command Generator} available 2 months prior to the competition in the official repository. Commands for EGPSR are either Stage~II tasks, complex commands requiring to perform chains of subtasks in sequence, or \emph{incomplete} commands lacking relevant information to succeed.

	\item \textbf{Naive Operators:} Commands can be issued by a \emph{Naive Operator} who receives a note-card with the summarized command from the referee and rephrases it.\\[0pt]
	\textbf{Remark:} Teams attempting to instruct or bias the operator will be disqualified.

	\item \textbf{Custom Operator fallback:} If the robot consistently fails to understand the naive or professional operator (i.e.~3 times), the referee will request a custom operator.

	\item \textbf{Data Recording:} Only when using Naive Operators, a team can get an additional scoring bonus by providing the recording and transcript of the issued commands.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per given command as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Custom operator:} Providing a custom operator causes 150pts score reduction.
	\item \textbf{Further assistance:} Helping a robot to accomplish a task causes 50--400pts score reduction, based on referee criterion and number of bypassed subtasks.
	\item \textbf{Bypassing commands:} A robot instructing a human assistant on how to accomplish the whole task receives no points for the command.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Attending when called:} The robot should approach to the operator when called (e.g.~by saying\textit {Robot, I need help!}). The operator may call the robot from a different room.

	\item \textbf{Robot Standby Point:} At the beginning of the test, and after finishing the first and second command, the robot moves to the \textit{Robot Standby Point}.

	\item \textbf{Leaving the \Arena{}:} A bonus scoring of 100pts can be earned if the robot autonomously leaves the \Arena{} after successfully executing all three given commands.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{OC instructions}

\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate the commands and prepare the note-cards, hiding them from teams.
	\item Announce the location of the \emph{Standby Point}.
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{During the test}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Rearrange the \Arena{} to its normal condition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the note-cards to the operators.
	\item Tell the operator from where to call the robot.
\end{itemize}
