\section{Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot}
\label{test:egpsr}
The robot is asked to maintain the household by cleaning up the arena and assisting people.


\noindent \textbf{Main Goal:} Solve 3 problems in the arena.\\


\subsection*{Focus}
\emph{Task planning}, \emph{object/people detection and recognition}, \emph{object feature recognition}, \emph{object manipulation}

\subsection*{Setup}
The arena is in its default state apart from problems set up for the robot to solve:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Problems:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Objects:} Objects that are not in their default location should be returned there (see \ref{rule:scenario_objects}). Objects on the floor are to be thrown in the trash or returned to their default location.
			\item \textbf{Persons:} Some persons in the arena will have requests for the robot. They will raise their hand if the robot is in the same room.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring (per \emph{solved} problem).

	\item \textbf{Command Generator:} Problems and commands will be generated using the official command generator\footnote{\url{https://github.com/johaq/CommandGenerator}}.
	\item \textbf{Finding People:} Finding a person and stating they need help is enough to get the scoring item. 
	\item \textbf{Understanding Commands:} Understanding and and correctly repeating the command given by a person can be counted towards partially solving a problem.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Setup the problems in the arena.
	\item Provide commands to volunteers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC instructions}

At least two hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate the problems and commands (don't reveal them to the teams!).
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}
