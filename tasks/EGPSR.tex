\section{Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot}\label{test:egpsr}
The robot is asked to maintain the household by cleaning up the arena and assisting people.


\noindent \textbf{Main Goal:} Solve different problems in the arena.\\


\subsection*{Focus}
\emph{Task planning}, \emph{object/people detection and recognition}, \emph{object feature recognition}, \emph{object manipulation}

\subsection*{Setup}
The arena is in its default state apart from problems set up for the robot to solve:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Problems:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Trash:} Objects on the floor are to be thrown in the trash.
			\item \textbf{Objects:} Objects that are not in their default location should be returned there (see~\ref{rule:scenario_objects}). 
			\item \textbf{Persons:} Some persons in the arena will have requests for the robot. They will raise their hand if the robot is in the same room.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Test start:} The robot enters when the arena door is open.
	\item \textbf{Finding Problems:} The robot has to find problems to solve on its own.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Number of Problems:} The number of problems depends on the arena size the minimum count of generated problems is 8.
	\item \textbf{Repeating Problem Category:} Solving the same Category of Problem incurs a penalty. 
	\item \textbf{Solving more:} You can continue solving problems to compensate for penalties.
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring (per \emph{solved} problem).
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Scores:} Score reduction is applied as a percentage depending on the solution.
		\item \textbf{Penalties:} The Repetition penalty is applied before any partial penalties
		\item \textbf{Example:} If Picking up trash off the floor is valued as 60\% of the solution. Requesting handover should be a $ 650 \times 0.6 = 390 $ points penalty for the first pick and  $ \left( 650 - 300 \right) \times 0.6 = 210 $ for the second pick.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Command Generator:} Problems and commands will be generated using the official command generator\footnote{\url{https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/CommandGenerator}}.
	\item \textbf{Finding People:} Finding a person and stating they need help counts as finding the problem.
	\item \textbf{Understanding Commands:} Understanding and correctly repeating the command given by a person can be counted towards partially solving a problem.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Setup the problems in the arena.
	\item Provide commands to volunteers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC instructions}

At least two hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate the problems and commands (don't reveal them to the teams!).
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}
