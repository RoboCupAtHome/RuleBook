\section{P\&G Challenge}
\label{test:clean-the-table}
The robot has to remove all dishes from a table after dinner and place them into the dishwasher.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI, \MAN{} \CV{}, \OR{}.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Place all the cutlery and tableware inside the dishwasher.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1000pts (150pts per cutlery, 100pts per tableware)

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the dishwasher door (150pts)
	\item Pulling out the dishwasher racks (250pts)
	\item Placing a dishwasher tab inside the dishwasher (350pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} This test takes place in the arena. A dining table is located close to the dishwasher.
	
	\item \textbf{Table Setting:} Placed on the table are: 
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item 8 objects with 4 being cutlery and 4 tableware (see~\ref{sec:rules:scenario:objects}).
		\item One dishwasher tab.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Dishwasher:} The team chooses whether the dishwasher is open and whether the racks are pulled out.
	
	\item \textbf{Safe Placing:} Objects must be placed with care. It must be clear that the robot is trying to place the object, not throwing or dropping it.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Placing Objects:} Since placing objects is the main focus of the test, asking a human to place something is not allowed.
	
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial (per object) scoring.
	
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per object as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Request Object Handover}: Asking to hand over an object causes a score reduction of 75pts.
		\item \textbf{Request Object Locations by Gesture:} Pointing at an object to be picked up or where to place an object causes a reduction of 40pts.

	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Award:} Teams that carry out this task are eligible to win the \PGAward{} and a prize sponsored by P\&G. The winner is chosen by representatives of P\&G.

\end{enumerate}
