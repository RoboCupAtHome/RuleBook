\subsubsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Locations:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Test location:} This test takes place in the kitchen.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{People:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item No people are involved in the test, unless the robot requires human assistance.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Furniture:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Dining table:} A dining table is located close to the dishwasher.
			\item \textbf{Tray:} A plastic tray, which may have other tableware and cutlery placed inside, is located either on top of the dishwasher or on one of the racks. Objects can be placed either in the dishwasher rack or in the tray, based on the team's choice.
		\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Dishwasher door and rack}: Half an hour before the test, the team informs the referees:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item whether objects will be placed in the dishwasher rack or in the tray
			\item whether the dishwasher door should be closed and, if the door is open, whether the rack should be pushed in
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Test start:} The robot moves to the kitchen when the arena door is open.
	\item \textbf{Table clean up:} The robot cleans the table by putting all items that are on it in the dishwasher.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safe placing:} Objects must be placed with care, namely the robot should place rather than throw or drop objects.
	\item \textbf{Dishwasher:} The team decides whether the robot will place the objects in the dishwasher's rack or in the plastic tray.
	\item \textbf{Dishwasher door:} The dishwasher door is open and with the racks pulled out by default.
	The team leader can, however, request the dishwasher to be closed for bonus points. If the robot fails to open the door, it must clearly state this and request the referee to open the door.
	\item \textbf{Correct item placement:} The items should be placed in the rack/tray correctly, namely in the location and in a manner as a person would put them.
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} The scores are reduced if human assistance is received, in particular:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item pointing to an object or telling the robot where an object is
		\item handing an object over to the robot
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{OC Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide official cutlery and tableware for training.
\end{itemize}
