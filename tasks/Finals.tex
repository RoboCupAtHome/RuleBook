\chapter{Finals}

The competition ends with the Finals on the last day, where the two teams with the highest total score compete.

Even though each league has its own first, second and third place, the \iterm{Finals} are meant to show the best of all leagues to the jury members as well as the audience and, thus, warrants a single schedule slot.

\section{Scoring}
The final score and ranking are determined by the jury evaluations and by the previous performance (in Stages I and II) of the team, in the following manner:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The influence of the final ranking is \SI{50}{\percent}.
  \item The influence of the total sum of points scored by the team in Stage I and II is \SI{50}{\percent}.
\end{enumerate}

There is no maximum score during the Final.

These demonstrations are carried out in a serialized fashion, one League performing after another in one \Arena{}.

\subsection{Task}
The procedure for the demonstration is the same as for Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot (see~Task~\ref{test:egpsr}) with the added tasks of:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Closing Furniture:} Doors of the Cabinet as well as the Dishwasher need to be closed.
\item \textbf{Welcome Guest:} There is an additional Person waiting behind the Exit door.
\item \textbf{Custom Tasks:} Additional reasonable household task.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Custom Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Requesting Additional Tasks:} Additional reasonable household tasks may be requested for scoring during the team leader meetings. These tasks must be approved by the \TC{}.

\item \textbf{Arena-Specific Tasks:} Depending on the arena setup, certain household chores may be delegated to the robot for completion. Examples of tasks that may be handled by the robot include, but are not limited to, window cleaning and picture alignment on the wall.

\item \textbf{Provision of Required Items} In the event that additional items are necessary for the completion of a task (e.g., clothing for folding, watering cans), the requesting team is responsible for supplying these items. All requested items must be provided and made available to the competitors prior to the day of the final.
\end{enumerate}
