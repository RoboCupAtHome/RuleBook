\chapter{Finals}

The competition ends with the Finals on the last day, where the two teams with the highest total score compete.

Even though each league has its own first, second and third place, the \iterm{Finals} are meant to show the best of all leagues to the jury members as well as the audience and, thus, warrants a single schedule slot.

\section{Scoring}
The final score and ranking are determined by the jury evaluations and by the previous performance (in Stages I and II) of the team, in the following manner:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The influence of the final ranking is \SI{50}{\percent}.
  \item The influence of the total sum of points scored by the team in Stage I and II is \SI{50}{\percent}.
\end{enumerate}

There is no maximum score during the Final.

These demonstrations are carried out in a serialized fashion, one League performing after another in one \Arena{}.

\subsection{Task}
The procedure for the demonstration is the same as for Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot (see~Task~\ref{test:egpsr}) with the added tasks of:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Closing Furniture:} Doors of the Cabinet as well as the Dishwasher need to be closed.
\item \textbf{Welcome Guest:} There is an additional person waiting behind the exit door. The person will state their request after being welcomed by the robot. The door must be opened without human assistance. As the position is known, there will be no points awarded for finding this person.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Show Must Go On}
To ensure a good experience for the audience the teams are allowed to restart the robot inside the arena.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item All previously collected points will be kept.
  \item The tasks may be rearranged by the Referee during a restart.
  \item The restart penalty is only applied if the robot continues scoring afterwards.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Commentator}
The team will be asked to provide a commentator to explain the robot's behavior and answer questions to produce a better viewing experience for the audience.
