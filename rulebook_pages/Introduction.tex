\section{RoboCup}

\RoboCup{} is an international joint project to promote AI, robotics, and related fields.
It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent-robotics research by providing standard problems where a wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. More information can be found at \url{http://www.robocup.org/}.

\section{RoboCup@Home}

The \textsc{RoboCup@Home} league aims to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications.
It is the largest international annual competition for autonomous service robots and is part of the RoboCup initiative.
A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the abilities and performance of different robots in a realistic, non-standardized home environment setting.
The focus is on, but is not limited to, the following domains: human-robot interaction and cooperation, navigation and mapping in dynamic environments, computer vision and object recognition under natural light conditions, object manipulation, adaptive behaviors, behavior integration, ambient intelligence, standardization and system integration.
The competition is co-located with the RoboCup symposium.
