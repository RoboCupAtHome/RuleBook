\chapter{General Rules and Regulations}
\label{chap:rules}

These are the general rules and regulations for the competition in the \RoboCup\AtHome{} league.
Every rule in this section can be considered to implicitly include the term \emph{\enquote{unless stated otherwise}}.
This means that additional or contrary rules, in particular with respect to the specification of tests, have a higher priority than those mentioned in the general rules and regulations.
