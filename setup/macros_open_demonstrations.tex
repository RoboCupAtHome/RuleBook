    \item \textbf{Interview and cleanup:} After the demonstration, there is
	      another \timing{#2 minutes} where the team answers %
    questions by the jury members.\\%
    During the interview time, the team has to undo its changes to the environment.%

}

\newcommand{\OpenDemonstrationChanges}{
  \subsection{Changes to the environment}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Making changes:} As in the other open demonstrations, teams are allowed to make modifications to the arena as they like, 
    but under the condition that they are reversible.
    \item \textbf{Undoing changes:} In the interview and cleanup team, changes need to be made undone by the team. 
    The team has to leave the arena in the \emph{very same} condition they entered it.
