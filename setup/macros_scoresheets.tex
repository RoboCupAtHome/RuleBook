% A scoresheet must be in a separated tex file. Scoring marks are
% presented as a list within the {scorelist} environment. Each
% mark is enlisted using the \scoreitem macro. Headings can be
% defined with the \scoreheading macro. Within the scoresheet
% booklet the {scorelist} environment shall be placed inside the
% {scoresheet} environment that adds the footer and heading required
% by the referee.
