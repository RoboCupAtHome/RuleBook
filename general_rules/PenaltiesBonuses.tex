\section{Special penalties and bonuses}\label{sec:special_awards}

\subsection{Penalty for not attending}\label{rule:not_attending}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Automatic schedule:} All teams are automatically scheduled for all tests.
	\item \textbf{Announcement:} If a team cannot participate in a test (for any reason), the team leader has to announce this to the OC at least \timing{60 minutes} before the test slot begins.
	\item \textbf{Penalties:} A team that is not present at the start position when their scheduled test starts, the team is not allowed to participate in the test anymore. If the team has not announced that it is not going to participate, it gets a penalty of \scoring{\penaltybig points}. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extraordinary penalties}\label{rule:extraordinary_penalties}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Penalty for inoperative robots:} If a team starts a test, but it does not solve any of the partial tasks (and is obviously not trying to do so), a penalty of \scoring{\penaltysmall points} is handed out. The decision is made by the referees and the monitoring TC member.  
	\item \textbf{Extra penalty for collision:} In case of major, (grossly) negligent collisions the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} may disqualify the team for a test (the team receives \scoring{0 points}), or for the entire competition.
	\item \textbf{Not showing up as referee or jury member:} If a team does not provide a referee or jury member (being at the arena on time), the team receives a penalty of \scoring{\penaltybig points}, and will be remembered for qualification decisions in future competitions.\\
	Jury members missing a performance to evaluate are excluded from the jury, and the team is 	disqualified from the challenge (receives \scoring{0 points}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bonus for outstanding performance}\label{rule:outstanding_performance}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For every regular test in \iterm{Stage~I} and \iterm{Stage~II}, the @Home \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} can decide to give an extra bonus for \iterm{outstanding performance} of up to 10\% of the maximum test score. 
	\item This is to reward teams that do more than what is needed to solely score points in a test but show innovative and general approaches to enhance the scope of @Home. 
	\item If a team thinks that it deserves this bonus, it should announce (and briefly explain) this to the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} beforehand.
	\item It is the decision of the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} if (and to which degree) the bonus score is granted.
\end{enumerate}
