### RoboCup
RoboCup
is an international joint project to promote AI, robotics, and related fields.  It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing standard problems where a wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined.  More information can be found at [http://www.robocup.org/](http://www.robocup.org/).

### RoboCup@Home
The RoboCup@Home league aims to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications. It is the largest international annual compe- tition for autonomous service robots and is part of the RoboCup initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots abilities and performance in a realistic non-standardized home environment setting.  Focus lies on the following domains but is not limited to:  Human-Robot- Interaction  and  Cooperation,  Navigation  and  Mapping  in  dynamic  environments,  Computer Vision and Object Recognition under natural light conditions, Object Manipulation, Adaptive Behaviors, Behavior Integration, Ambient Intelligence, Standardization and System Integration. It is collocated with the RoboCup symposium.

### Contributing
The RoboCup @Home Organizing Committee is always looking for volunteers to assist in the events and willing to help to maintain the sites. Volunteers can help in tasks such as organizing and categorizing publications, team videos, memories, scores, press, and writing examples and extended rule explanations. Other projects such as developing utilities for the competition and tools for referees are also welcome. If you would like to collaborate, write to any of the members of the Organizing Committee.

Contributions and improvements to the rulebook are always welcome in the form of pull requests.

### Building

The easiest way is to utilize the `docker.io/texlive/texlive:TL2022-historic` image to build everything.

For convenience, you should execute `build.sh` to make the PDFs with a container runtime. (This requires either `docker` or `podman` to be installed)
