### Change log
The Rulebook has being completely restructured for 2019 and later competitions.
The new format was first tested at German Open 2019.

#### Highlights
- **Less stressful competition:** Each competition day will have 2 *testing blocks* (e.g.from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 15:00 to 18:00), giving time to teams to eat, rest, and prepare.
- **Thematic *free* testing:** Each *testing block* will have assigned a *scenario*, namely cleaning the house or hosting a party. Teams will have assigned at least 2 testing slots to solve the *task* of their choise.
- **Task-driven testing:** Tests are no more. The rulebook will have a battery of tasks featuring different abilities from which teams can choose which to solve. It won't be possible to solve all tasks.
- **Goal-driven scoring:** A robot can only score by accomplishing the *main goal* of a *task*. In addition to the *main goal*, several bonus objectives are available with juicy rewards, but will be only considered if the *main goal* is completed.
- **Unlimited *Continues*:** The continue rule is no more. Instead, robots may call for a *Deus Ex Machina* and have human assistant helping it to solve the task. There is no limit on the number of times a robot can ask for help, and the nature of the help is unconstrained. Nonetheless, a proportional score reduction applies.

These changes obey to one objective: **robots must succeed**.

### RoboCup
RoboCup
is an international joint project to promote AI, robotics, and related fields.  It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing standard problems where a wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined.  More information can be found at [http://www.robocup.org/](http://www.robocup.org/).

### RoboCup@Home
The RoboCup@Home league aims to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications. It is the largest international annual compe- tition for autonomous service robots and is part of the RoboCup initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots abilities and performance in a realistic non-standardized home environment setting.  Focus lies on the following domains but is not limited to:  Human-Robot- Interaction  and  Cooperation,  Navigation  and  Mapping  in  dynamic  environments,  Computer Vision and Object Recognition under natural light conditions, Object Manipulation, Adaptive Behaviors, Behavior Integration, Ambient Intelligence, Standardization and System Integration. It is collocated with the RoboCup symposium.

### Contributing
The RoboCup @Home Organizing Committee is always looking for volunteers to assist in the events and willing to help to maintain the sites. Volunteers can help in tasks such as organizing and categorizing publications, team videos, memories, scores, press, and writing examples and extended rule explanations. Other projects such as developing utilities for the competition and tools for referees are also welcome. If you would like to collaborate, write to any of the members of the Organizing Committee.

Contributions and improvements to the rulebook are always welcome in the form of pull requests.
